.SH DESCRIPTION
msfpayload is a command-line instance of Metasploit that is used to generate and output all of the various types of shellcode that are available in Metasploit. The most common use of this tool is for the generation of shellcode for an exploit that is not currently in the Metasploit Framework or for testing different types of shellcode and options before finalizing a module.
